# Pacer
Running Splits Calculator
1. A tool to figure out running time splits and print them out so that I could have them during races.
2. It is a simple tool, but does provide accurate splits and a way to print them out on a piece of paper to take to races.
3. The user inputs their distance they want to run and the time they hope to complete the run in and get a list of splits for every mile so that they can accomplish their goal.
4. I did all of the work on my own.
5. If I could spend more time on the project I would add more input validation and more functional flexability. Such as the ability to use kilometers and to have a set running pace and then see your overall goal time. I want to redo it and use React next time, just to learn the technology and better organize the code.
6. Clone the repo into a folder and then in your browser go to folder/Pacer/index.html and you should see the Running Splits Calculator.
